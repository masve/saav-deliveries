    "> What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is [NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95). It contains records for every reported incident in the NYC area. Records are available from July 2012 till today. Specifically, where the collision took place, the cause of the collision, injuries, fatalities and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thhe other dataset used was an extraction of weather conditions for the NYC area. This was pulled from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com) using their csv service for hourly updates. For each hour, there are measurements of the temperature, visibility, windspeed as well as the overall weather conditions such as Rain, Snow, Clear etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the collisions dataset, was mainly out of interest in finding out where, how and why collisions happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather dataset was an afterthough and was mainly something we wanted to investigate after having looked collisions and the road conditions / traffic infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal is to provide the user/reader with knowledge about how the weather affects the road and in that sense the collision rate. We would assume that more collisions happens in bad conditions, but can we quantify that? The user should also end up with an idea of where incidents happens the most, maybe to give an idea for the government of NYC for improvements. "

That is, KNN and Decision Trees.\n",
